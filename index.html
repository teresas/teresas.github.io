					<p>I was raised and currently live in the suburbs of Chicago.</p>
					<p>After graduating college, I started out as a graphic designer.</p>
					<p>Now I write front-end <a href="https://github.com/teresas" target="_blank">code</a> for <a href="https://globus.org" target="_blank">Globus</a>.</p>
					<p>In my spare time, I try to sew clothing and other projects like purses.</p>
					<p>Photography and fine arts were passions of mine growing up.</p>
					<p>In February 2018, I decided to start a ketogenic diet.</p>
					<p>I like to bake tasty treats and am always looking for new recipes.</p>
					<p>One time a squirrel broke into my apartment and ate my pizza.</p>
					<p>I chased him out with a Swiffer Sweeper.</p>
					<p>I'm married to a super spiffy CPA, but I can't say that three times fast.</p>
					<p>I have an Atari 2600, which I call my "baby".</p>
					<p>For about a year, I attempted roller derby. (I was terrible)</p>
					<p>Going to the movies is a favorite pastime of mine.</p>
