				<h1>Teresa Gugerty</h1>
				<p>I started out as a graphic designer.</p>
				<p>Now I write front-end <a href="https://github.com/teresas" target="_blank">code</a> for <a href="https://globus.org" target="_blank">Globus</a>.</p>
				<p>I also try to sew clothing and other projects like purses.</p>
				<p>Photography and fine arts were passions of mine growing up.</p>
				<p>Back in February, I decided to start a ketogenic diet.</p>
				<p>I bake cookies and other tasty treats and am always looking for new recipes.</p>
				<p>One time a squirrel broke into my apartment and ate my pizza.</p>
				<p>I chased him with a Swiffer Sweeper.</p>
				<p>My husband is a super spiffy CPA, but I can't say that three times fast.</p>
				<p>I don't have any children, but I do have an Atari 2600 which I've called my "baby".</p>
				<p>For about a year, I attempted roller derby. (I was terrible)</p>
				<p>Watching movies is a favorite passtime of mine.</p>
